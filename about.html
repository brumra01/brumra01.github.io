<h2>Rachel's Story</h2>
<p>Rachel was born in Minneapolis, MN and then shortly thereafter moved to Milwaukee, WI with her mom and dad. At two years of age she was joined by her sister, Mary Kate. Together the family moved to Waunakee, WI where Mary Kate and Rachel attended elementary school. In fourth grade the family moved once again to Onalaska, WI, where they continue to live today.</p>
<p>Rachel has always been interested in reading, writing, and thinking about politics. This is perhaps what made her become a political science major. She knows, however, that political science isn't necessarily the field she wants to be in for a career, so she also picked up a business management major. She's thinking about a career in marketing, but really the door is wide open to many possibilities.</p>
